## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project
This project is a command line version of the classic WordGuess constructor. This game uses similar logic browser based wordguessing game created, but with this game, I created a command line version using Javascript constructor functions to create letter and word objects, the inquirer npm package to prompt users to guess a letter, and Node.js to run the Javascript code from the command line. For more information on how this project was constructed and put together, see [Structure of the project](#structure-of-project).
